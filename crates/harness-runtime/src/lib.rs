//! The provider command runtime every NDDev setup system shares.
//!
//! Five products, one set of commands. What differs between them is not
//! behaviour but *facts*: which directory a product configures, which files
//! inside it this provider owns, and which files belong to the product and must
//! be left alone. [`Harness`] holds those facts; [`wire::dispatch`] performs the
//! commands over them.
//!
//! Written this way, a change to the shared logic lands once instead of five
//! times, and a change to one product's surface lands in exactly one struct that
//! a test binds to that product's verified baseline.
//!
//! # What this runtime does and does not do
//!
//! It applies `backup`, `restore` and `remove`, and it plans all five core
//! operations. `install` and `replace` are planned and then refuse, naming the
//! missing piece — a reader for the bundle format. They stay declared because
//! the contract requires all five core operations, and a refusal that names the
//! real limitation is honest in a way a narrowed declaration could not be.
//!
//! The software lifecycle and `launch` are optional in the contract and are not
//! declared at all. Declaring an optional operation this runtime cannot perform
//! would let a consumer call something that cannot be honoured, which is worse
//! than not offering it.
