//! The exclusive lock every mutation holds, and the durable write it protects.
//!
//! The lock is bound to the canonical target directory, not to a process, a
//! user or a setup id. Two managers pointed at the same target contend; two
//! pointed at different targets never do.
//!
//! Acquisition is non-blocking on purpose. A caller that waits silently on a
//! lock held by a crashed process looks identical to a caller doing slow work,
//! and the consumer's timeout would then be charged to the wrong cause.
//!
//! # Why the operating-system lock is not enough on its own
//!
//! Advisory file locks differ in what they are owned by. A POSIX record lock is
//! owned by the *process*, so a second acquisition from inside one process
//! succeeds and silently merges with the first: no contention is reported, and
//! two code paths both believe they hold the target exclusively. Other flavours
//! bind to the open file description and do report it.
//!
//! This kernel does not depend on which flavour a platform provides. Each setup
//! system ships one binary with two surfaces, so a wire command and a human
//! command can reach this lock in one process; [`HELD_TARGETS`] claims the path
//! in-process first, and only then is the operating-system lock taken for the
//! cross-process case. Both are released on drop, and the in-process refusal is
//! the same on every platform.
